# Supported features

This document tracks FabricOps feature support against the upstream
[hyperledger-labs/fablo](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fablo) feature
matrix. Fablo remains the compatibility benchmark because FabricOps should
eventually cover as much of that practical Fabric-network surface area as makes
sense on Kubernetes.

The `Fablo v2` and `Fablo v3` columns describe upstream Fablo support for
Hyperledger Fabric 2.5.x and 3.1.x. The `FabricOps status` column describes the
current operator implementation in this repository.

The `CI tests` column may stay empty until a stable per-feature workflow link
exists. Feature notes call out kind e2e, Helm smoke, or envtest coverage when
that proof is already present.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Supported | Implemented in FabricOps and validated through envtest, kind e2e, Helm smoke, OrbStack smoke, or focused build tests |
| Partial | Some support exists, but the behavior is incomplete or not broadly validated |
| Planned | Target feature, not implemented yet |
| Not applicable | Fablo feature does not map directly to the Kubernetes operator model |
| Not validated | Likely possible through configuration, but not verified yet |

## Version baseline

| Project | Fabric v2 baseline | Fabric v3 baseline | Notes |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| Fablo reference | 2.5.12 | 3.1.0 | Upstream Fablo supported-features baseline |
| FabricOps | Not validated yet | 3.1.0 | Current kind and Helm smokes use Fabric `3.1.0`; the operator accepts `spec.global.fabricVersion` |
